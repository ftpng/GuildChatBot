# GuildChatBot
This project connects a Minecraft bot to a Discord webhook.
It listens for guild chat messages and events in Minecraft and forwards them to a specified Discord channel.
It also allows sending messages from Discord (or any WebSocket client) back into Minecraft guild chat.

# Features
- Logs in to a Minecraft server using Microsoft authentication.
- Detects guild chat messages (`Guild > [Rank] Username: message`) and sends them to Discord.
- Posts guild join/leave/kick messages to Discord.
- Formats usernames with ranks and uses Minecraft avatars as Discord webhook icons.
- Provides a WebSocket API (`ws://localhost:8080`) for sending messages into guild chat.
